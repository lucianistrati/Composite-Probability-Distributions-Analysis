# Composite-Probability-Distributions

## Overview

This repository contains code for generating and analyzing gamma and normal distributions. It provides functions to generate synthetic data samples from these distributions, plot histograms of the generated data, and compare the generated statistics with theoretical values.

## Features

- **Gamma Distribution**: Generates synthetic data samples from a gamma distribution with specified parameters. It plots the histogram of the generated data and compares the mean, variance, and standard deviation with theoretical values.

- **Normal Distribution**: Generates synthetic data samples from a normal distribution with specified mean and variance. It plots the histogram of the generated data and compares the mean, variance, and standard deviation with theoretical values.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/distribution-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd distribution-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can run the main script to generate synthetic data samples and analyze the distributions. Modify the parameters in the script to experiment with different distribution characteristics.

```bash
python main.py
```

## File Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
distribution-analysis/
